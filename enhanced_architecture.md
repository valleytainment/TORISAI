# Enhanced TORIS AI Architecture

## Overview

Based on the latest architectural guidance, TORIS AI will be enhanced to provide a comprehensive local alternative to Manus AI by integrating best-in-class open-source components. This document outlines the updated architecture that leverages multiple specialized tools to create a powerful, privacy-focused AI assistant with zero cloud costs.

## Core Components

### 1. Local LLM Backend: Ollama

Ollama will serve as our primary reasoning engine, providing:
- One-line installation process
- Support for multiple high-quality models (Llama 3, DeepSeek, Qwen)
- Simple HTTP API for integration
- Optimized for local execution on consumer hardware
- Compatible with the user's Intel i5-8400 CPU and 12GB RAM

**Implementation Details:**
- Primary model: llama3:8b (balanced performance/resource usage)
- Fallback model: qwen:7b (lighter resource footprint)
- Access via HTTP API at http://localhost:11434

### 2. Command Execution: Open Interpreter

Open Interpreter will provide a secure environment for executing code and system commands:
- REPL environment for Python, JavaScript, and shell commands
- Natural language to code translation
- Sandboxed execution for safety
- Integrated error handling and debugging

**Implementation Details:**
- Custom integration with our GUI
- Configurable execution permissions
- Output capture and display in the code execution panel

### 3. Orchestration Layer: SuperAGI

SuperAGI will serve as our agent framework, handling:
- Autonomous planning and task decomposition
- Task scheduling and execution
- Long-term memory management
- Concurrent agent support
- GUI dashboard for monitoring

**Implementation Details:**
- Configuration to use local Ollama endpoint
- Specialized agent roles (Planner, Coder, Researcher, Desktop)
- Integration with our custom GUI

### 4. Skills and Tools Framework

We'll combine multiple frameworks for a comprehensive toolset:
- LangChain's tool framework for standardized tool definitions
- TARVIS-LLM components for desktop automation
- Smolagents for safe code execution and sandboxing

**Implementation Details:**
- Custom tool registry for unified access
- Tool discovery and dynamic loading
- Permission management for sensitive operations

### 5. Memory System: Chroma/FAISS

For long-term context and knowledge retrieval:
- Vector-based storage via Chroma or FAISS
- Integration through LangChain's memory modules
- Persistent conversation history
- Document embedding and retrieval

**Implementation Details:**
- Chroma DB for primary storage
- Configurable retention policies
- Memory visualization in the GUI

## Specialized Agent Roles

### Planner Agent
- Decomposes complex tasks into manageable subtasks
- Creates execution plans with dependencies
- Monitors progress and adjusts plans as needed

### Coder Agent
- Writes and executes code safely using smolagents
- Debugs issues and explains solutions
- Manages project files and dependencies

### Researcher Agent
- Handles web searches and information gathering
- Summarizes findings and extracts key information
- Maintains research context across sessions

### Desktop Agent
- Controls GUI applications via TARVIS tools
- Automates repetitive tasks
- Provides screen capture and analysis

## System Integration

The components will be integrated through:
1. A unified configuration system
2. Standardized message passing between components
3. A central event bus for component communication
4. A custom launcher script that:
   - Starts Ollama with the chosen model
   - Configures and launches SuperAGI
   - Loads TARVIS-LLM skills
   - Sets up Chroma for vector storage
   - Launches the custom GUI

## User Interface

The modern GUI will provide:
- Chat interface for natural language interaction
- Agent status monitoring
- Memory visualization
- Code execution environment
- Command console for direct tool access
- Settings for configuration management

## Advantages Over Previous Design

This enhanced architecture offers several improvements:
1. **More Robust Orchestration**: SuperAGI provides advanced planning and task management
2. **Better Tool Integration**: Standardized framework for tool discovery and execution
3. **Enhanced Memory**: Vector-based retrieval for more contextual responses
4. **Specialized Agents**: Purpose-built agents for different task types
5. **Improved Desktop Control**: TARVIS-LLM components for better automation
6. **Safer Code Execution**: Smolagents for sandboxed code running

## Implementation Roadmap

1. Set up Ollama and verify model compatibility
2. Integrate SuperAGI as the orchestration layer
3. Implement tool framework with LangChain and TARVIS components
4. Configure Chroma for memory storage
5. Create specialized agent roles
6. Integrate with the modern GUI
7. Develop the launcher script
8. Test and validate the complete system

This enhanced architecture maintains the zero-cloud-cost approach while significantly expanding capabilities through best-in-class open-source components.
