# TORIS AI - Updated Cost-Effectiveness Validation

## Cost Comparison: TORIS AI vs. Manus AI

| Cost Category | Manus AI (estimated) | TORIS AI | Savings |
|---------------|----------------------|----------|---------|
| Subscription fees | $20-50/month | $0 | $240-600/year |
| API usage fees | Variable | $0 | Variable |
| Cloud storage | Variable | $0 | Variable |
| Hardware investment | Minimal | Already owned | $0 (using existing hardware) |
| Electricity costs | Minimal | $3-5/month | -$36-60/year |
| Maintenance costs | None | Minimal (time only) | Minimal difference |
| **Total Annual Cost** | **$240-600+** | **$36-60** | **$204-540+/year** |

## Return on Investment Analysis

For the user with existing hardware (Intel i5-8400, 12GB RAM):
- **Immediate ROI**: Zero additional investment needed
- **Annual savings**: $204-540+ (subscription costs avoided)
- **5-year savings**: $1,020-2,700+

## Privacy Value Proposition

Beyond direct cost savings, TORIS AI provides significant value through:
- Complete data sovereignty and privacy
- No vendor lock-in
- No risk of service discontinuation
- No internet dependency for core functionality
- Customization freedom

## Resource Efficiency with New GUI

| Resource | Utilization on i5-8400 | Optimization Potential |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------|
| CPU | 30-70% during inference | Model quantization, batch processing |
| RAM | 6-10GB depending on model | Smaller models for resource constraints |
| Storage | 5-10GB | Model pruning, selective component installation |
| GPU | Not required | Optional acceleration if available |

## Optimization Recommendations for User's Hardware

1. **Model Selection**: Optimized for 12GB RAM
   - Primary: Llama 3 8B (balanced performance)
   - Alternative: Qwen 7B (lighter resource usage)
   - Both models tested and confirmed compatible with i5-8400 CPU

2. **Background Applications**: Close memory-intensive applications when running TORIS AI

3. **Performance Tweaks**:
   - Set temperature parameter lower (0.5-0.7) for faster responses
   - Limit context window size if needed for memory efficiency
   - New GUI designed for minimal resource overhead
